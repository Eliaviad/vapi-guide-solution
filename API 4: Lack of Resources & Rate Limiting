Steps:
1) Send the mobile login request, and the server sends a 4-digit OTP. 
2) Try to send the verification request and see that the server sends an invalid OTP. 
3) Send the request to the intruder, and set the payload to be from 1000 to 9999. This will cover all 4-digit OTP. 
4) Filter the result status to find the one with 200.
5) Send the request with the correct OTP, and observe you get the token. 
6) Add the token from the request to the GET request. Donâ€™t forget to add the Authorization-Token header.
7) The server responds back with the flag: flag{api4_ce696239323ea5b2d015}

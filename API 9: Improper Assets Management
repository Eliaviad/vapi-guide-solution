Steps:
1) Send the login request. Note that the server returns two countdown headers 
  • X-RateLimit-Limit: 5
  • X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4
2) Each time we send a false request, the countime header goes down until zero. 
3) Note that the API is version 2; change it to v1 and observe that this time the headers are gone. 
4) Send the request to the intruder, and add the pin, set the payload to numbers from 1000 to 9999
5) Filter the results by the length, find the one with the high value, and find the successful login with the flag: flag{api9_81e306bdd20a7734e244}
